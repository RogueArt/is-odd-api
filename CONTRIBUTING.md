# Installation

Before you can revolutionize the world, we need you to download a few packages. Currently, we use NodeJS 14 for our server and React on the frontend.

1. Download NodeJS [here](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. Clone this project with `git clone https://github.com/RogueArt/is-odd-api`
3. Navigate to the folder in the terminal. Type `npm i` to install packages for the backend.
4. Then, type `cd client` and `npm i` to install packages for the frontend.

We also want you to follow good coding practices when you are changing the world. We use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) to enforce code consistency.

# Issues

Unlike other companies you may have worked at, as we are worldwide international, we have a faster-paced environment and are extreme team players. 

Task organization is done through Github issues and Github projects. You can see our projects roadmap [here](https://github.com/RogueArt/is-odd-api/projects).

If you would like to add a new buzzword (feature), then simply fork the project and make a pull request with the feature you're adding.

Feature branches should be named like this:
- `bug/<name>` - For bug fixes
- `feature/<feature-name>` - For new features
